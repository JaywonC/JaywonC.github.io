                   <p style='text-align: justified;'>
                    Hi, my name is Jaywon and I'm currently a junior at Tappan Zee High School. 
                    I’ve always loved trying new things, and my passion for learning led me to computer science. 
                    The intersection of technology and business fascinates me, and I’m eager to explore more in this area.
                    I created this website entirely by myself, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                    Feel free to explore my portfolio and learn more about my achievements, passions, and interests.
                    
                    I have added digital proof for awards and positions when possible. 
                    References and additional information are available upon request.

                <p>
                    I programmed a drivetrain and a climb function for our Robot. I also helped create and implement autonomous pathways for our robot. 
                    As a software lead I had to teach newer members how to program in java as well as how to program the robot.
                    I was a member of our team’s impact team and presented to judges at competition, I also presented to our

                <h3>Investment Club Founder and President 2023-2025</h3>
                <p>
                    During my sophomore year I started an investment club after noticing a lack of business oriented clubs at my school.
                    We started off by competing in the <a href="https://www.stockmarketgame.org/"
                    target="_blank">Stock Market Game</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the 2024-2025 school year we are competing in the <a href="https://globalyouth.wharton.upenn.edu/competitions/investment-competition/"
                    target="_blank"> Wharton Global High School
                    Investment Competition</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have secured 2 guest speakers who currently work in finance. We are planning to compete in other investment competitions and I hope 
                    to inspire and teach others the basics of investing. We are also working on a pontential school trip to Wall Street, NYC.
