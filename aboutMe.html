            <h2>Hi, I'm Jaywon Chae!</h2>
            <p>I'm a passionate student with a love for programming and technology. I've been involved in various volunteering activities, including teaching kids robotics, programming, and swimming. I also enjoy participating in community events and fundraisers.</p>
            <p>Currently, I'm working on building my personal website and enhancing my programming skills, particularly in C++. In addition to my tech interests, I actively contribute to my community through projects and school events.</p>
